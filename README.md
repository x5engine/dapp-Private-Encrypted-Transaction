# Provenance tracking dApp in Reactjs

## Goal: Create provenance tracking dApp with no centralized database

Create a web application that will surface history for a component tracked by a smart contract with no centralized database

In this challenge, the goal is to create a decentralized application with the VS Code extension, that will allow users to query the history of a component that is defined in a smart contract. This history will include that state change data, approximate time based on block/transaction data along with the user address of the user who made the change. The application should be built using ReactJS. It should be demonstrated that state changes (transactions) not initiated by the application can be inspected.
