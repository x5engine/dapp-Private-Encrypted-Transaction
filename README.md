# dApp Private Encrypted Transaction Quorum with Tessera on Azure Blockchain Service

## Goal: Create dApp that send Private Encrypted Transaction on Quorum with Tessera on-chain and off-chain on IPFS

Create A Solution That Uses Quorum Or Besu That Creates A Private Off Chain Transaction

It should include on-chain data (inside the smart contract) and off chain data as well. The key is that the off-chain data should be encrypted with the same key used for the on chain transaction.

In this challenge, the goal is to extend either Quorum’s Tessera or Besu’s Orion to include the option to pass off chain data that will be stored / retrieved as part of the on chain transaction. The underlying storage is up to you but using the private transaction manager to extend to support a database, IPFS, or even file system is the requirement. Extending the web3 client to support offchain data is needed, but the implementation is up to you!
